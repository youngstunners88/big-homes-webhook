## VS WHAT WE'RE DOING

| | Local AI | Etsy Digital |
|---|----------|--------------|
| **Revenue** | $200-500/client | $12/product |
| **Effort** | Sales calls | Create once |
| **Scaling** | Need more clients | Passive |
| **Risk** | High | Low |

**Etsy is more SEAMLESS** - no sales calls, no rejections, just create and collect.
