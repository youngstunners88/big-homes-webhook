## Opportunities I See

### 1. Same Model, Different Verticals

| Vertical | Pain Point | Monthly Value | Easy/Hard |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Dentists** | Missed appts = $1000s lost | $500-2000/mo | Easy |
| **Lawyers** | Missed consultation = lost cases | $1000-5000/mo | Medium |
| **Auto Repair** | Same as plumbing | $300-1500/mo | Easy |
| **Medical Practices** | Phone hell = lost patients | $2000+/mo | Medium |
| **Pet Grooming** | No show = lost revenue | $200-800/mo | Easy |

### 2. Adjacent Services (Use Same Leads)

| Service | Price | Effort |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Google Business Profile | $200 | Low |
| Review Generation | $100/mo | Low |
| SMS Marketing | $150/mo | Low |
| Google Ads Management | $500/mo | Medium |

### 3. Bigger Ticket - Wholesale Real Estate

- **FSBO calls** - "I want to buy your house"
- **Expired listings** - owners who gave up
- **Probate/inheritance** - motivated sellers
- **Ticket:** $5,000-20,000 per deal
- **Harder:** More competition, skeptical sellers

### 4. Even More Seamless (Passive)

| Idea | Effort | Passive? |
|------|--------|----------|
| **White-label AI** - Resell to agencies | High | Yes |
| **Lead broker** - Sell leads to marketers | Low | Yes |
| **TikTok AI content** - Influencers | Medium | No |
| **SMS autoresponder** - After hours | Low | Yes |

## My Honest Take

**What's easiest right now:**
1. Keep doing plumbers/HVAC/electricians
2. Add **dentists** - same playbook, bigger budgets
3. Add **review generation** - tiny effort, recurring $$$

**What I think you're missing:**
- **SMS follow-up** - texts after voicemail = 10x response
- **White-label reselling** - sell AI agents to other agencies
- **Appointment reminder system** - simple app, all businesses need

**Wholesale real estate:**
- Worth doing BUT different skill set
- More rejection, longer sales cycle
- If you want in, just start calling FSBOs
